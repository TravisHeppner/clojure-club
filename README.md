# Clojure-Club

Wherein we solve interesting problems on our own then compare to see how we did.

## How it works
Once a week a new problem will be posted. A package will be created in this project
for participants to post their solutions. Please put your solution in a ns with
the name $USER.clj.

## Problems

Problem 1: [Number Maze](http://www.4clojure.com/problem/106)
 * Compute the minimum number of steps required to go from integer S<sub>i</sub> 
 to S<sub>f</sub>.
 * Allowed operations are:
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub> + 2
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub> * 2
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub>  / 2 
 * Modify your solution to return a numeric path from S<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>f</sub>
 (Note that there are cases with more than one solution).
 * Modify your solution to return all minimum paths.
   * Examples of multiple minimum solutions:
     * 2 -> 4
     * 9 -> 2
     * 2 -> 9
 * Modify your solution to return all paths with interleaved operations. This would
 distinguish ambiguous solutions like [[2 4][2 4]], which would become 
 [[2 + 2 = 4][2 * 2 = 4]]. How the operations are expressed aren't important.
