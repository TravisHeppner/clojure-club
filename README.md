# Clojure-Club

Wherein we solve interesting problems on our own then compare to see how we did.

## How it works
Once a week a new problem will be posted. A package will be created in this project
for participants to post their solutions. Please put your solution in a ns with
the name $USER.clj.

## Problems
April 7th:

We'll be working on two problems - pick the one you want.
* Develop a quine in Clojure (https://www.4clojure.com/problem/125) and/or
* Develop a Sudoku solver
  * Boards will be a 9x9 nested vector with numeric or nil elements
  * Name you function `solve` so that we have a uniform interface
  * Note that there are several ways you could solve this including a search or using a 
  [logic programming library](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic)

Problem 2 (March 20, 2017 – March 24, 2017): [Analyze Reversi](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/124)

* Implement your solution as a cljc file (src/main/cljc/x124_analyze_reversi/$USERNAME.cljc rather than a .clj.
* If time allows, we’ll discuss reader conditionals, isomorphic Clojure, and the differences between clj, cljc, and cljs files.
* Finally, bonus points for porting last week’s solution to cljc (Hints: I/O can behave differently on different platforms. PersistentQueue is imported from different locations.).

Please submit your answer via git pull request to https://github.com/markbastian/clojure-club. However, if you email it to me I will continue to facilitate your bad behavior and add it myself.

Problem 1: [Number Maze](http://www.4clojure.com/problem/106)
 * Compute the minimum number of steps required to go from integer S<sub>i</sub> 
 to S<sub>f</sub>.
 * Allowed operations are:
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub> + 2
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub> * 2
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub>  / 2 
 * Modify your solution to return a numeric path from S<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>f</sub>
 (Note that there are cases with more than one solution).
 * Modify your solution to return all minimum paths.
   * Examples of multiple minimum solutions:
     * 2 -> 4
     * 9 -> 2
     * 2 -> 9
 * Modify your solution to return all paths with interleaved operations. This would
 distinguish ambiguous solutions like [[2 4][2 4]], which would become 
 [[2 + 2 = 4][2 * 2 = 4]]. How the operations are expressed aren't important.
