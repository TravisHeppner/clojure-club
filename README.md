# Clojure-Club

Wherein we solve interesting problems on our own then compare to see how we did.

## How it works
Once a week a new problem will be posted. A package will be created in this project
for participants to post their solutions. Please put your solution in a ns with
the name $USER.clj.

## Problems
#### April 21<sup>st</sup>: [Language of a DFA](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/164)

Read the problem description [here](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/164) for details.
 
 #### April 14<sup>th</sup>: [Universal Computation Engine](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/121)
 
 From [4clojure.com](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/121): "Given a mathematical formula 
 in prefix notation, return a function that calculates the value of the formula. The 
 formula can contain nested calculations using the four basic mathematical operators, 
 numeric constants, and symbols representing variables. The returned function has to 
 accept a single parameter containing the map of variable names to their values."
 
 **Note that you may not use eval or resolve.**
 
 I haven't spent much time thinking about *advanced* aspects of this problem, but for bonus
 points you might want to try the following:
  * Add transcendental functions (sin, cos, etc.)
  * Take a look at symbolic differentiation (This may be extra extra out of scope, just
  throwing it out there.)
  
#### April 7<sup>th</sup>:

We'll be working on two problems - pick the one you want.
* Develop a quine in Clojure (https://www.4clojure.com/problem/125) and/or
* Develop a Sudoku solver
  * Boards will be a 9x9 nested vector with numeric or nil elements
  * Name you function `solve` so that we have a uniform interface
  * Note that there are several ways you could solve this including a search or using a 
  [logic programming library](https://github.com/clojure/core.logic)

#### March 24<sup>th</sup>: [Analyze Reversi](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/124)

* Implement your solution as a cljc file (src/main/cljc/x124_analyze_reversi/$USERNAME.cljc rather than a .clj.
* If time allows, we’ll discuss reader conditionals, isomorphic Clojure, and the differences between clj, cljc, and cljs files.
* Finally, bonus points for porting last week’s solution to cljc (Hints: I/O can behave differently on different platforms. PersistentQueue is imported from different locations.).

Please submit your answer via git pull request to https://github.com/markbastian/clojure-club. However, if you email it to me I will continue to facilitate your bad behavior and add it myself.

#### March 17<sup>th</sup>: [Number Maze](http://www.4clojure.com/problem/106)
 * Compute the minimum number of steps required to go from integer S<sub>i</sub> 
 to S<sub>f</sub>.
 * Allowed operations are:
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub> + 2
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub> * 2
   * S<sub>i+1</sub> = S<sub>i</sub>  / 2 
 * Modify your solution to return a numeric path from S<sub>i</sub> to S<sub>f</sub>
 (Note that there are cases with more than one solution).
 * Modify your solution to return all minimum paths.
   * Examples of multiple minimum solutions:
     * 2 -> 4
     * 9 -> 2
     * 2 -> 9
 * Modify your solution to return all paths with interleaved operations. This would
 distinguish ambiguous solutions like [[2 4][2 4]], which would become 
 [[2 + 2 = 4][2 * 2 = 4]]. How the operations are expressed aren't important.
